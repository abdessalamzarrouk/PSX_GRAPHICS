# PSX_GRAPHICS
Welcome to this ambitious project of mine where I try to understand and implement some of the [PsyQ library](https://psx.arthus.net/sdk/Psy-Q/) functions and concepts to make cool looking 3D effects. These are the current examples i've made that run using [PCSX-REDUX](https://github.com/grumpycoders/pcsx-redux) :
# Current Examples :
## Triangle :
This is a simple rotating triangle made using a Struct called **POLY_G3** , you can check the documentation in this link for more info about the [**POLY_G3**](https://psx.arthus.net/sdk/Psy-Q/DOCS/LibRef47.pdf) Struct.

## Pyramid : 
In this example, I had to make the 4 triangle faces with the **POLY_G3** Struct , I will try to make the base of the triangle look good because it's glitching but for the mean time there is no base.
